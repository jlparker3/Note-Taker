## Purpose
The purpose of the application is to keep track of daily tasks and have an organized mindset by using this convenient app that will allow you to write, save, and delete notes. 


## My experience
Once I grasped the concept of routing it was a fun and usful application to make. I can see myself working with this with pride that I build this through some keystrokes.
